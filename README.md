## Technologies Used

This boilerplate utilizes the following technologies:

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments.
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for serving FastAPI applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shantobhai1214/hackathon-backend.git
   cd hackathon-backend
   ```

2. **Set Up Docker**:

   Ensure you have Docker installed. You can check the installation by running:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**:

   Run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   Start the application with:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Access the API**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the interactive API documentation.
