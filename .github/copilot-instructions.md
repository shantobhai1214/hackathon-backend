We use FastAPI as the web framework, with Pydantic for all data validation and serialization tasks. The codebase must be structured in a clear and maintainable way, with a strong emphasis on modularity and reusability. We organize the project into separate files for API routes, middleware, configuration, and validation schemas to ensure clarity and scalability. We always use the latest stable versions of FastAPI, Pydantic, to benefit from the newest features and security updates.

Every route, request, and response in the application must be validated using Pydantic models. This ensures data integrity and robust error handling throughout the codebase. All code should be written in modern Python (3.12+), leveraging type hints, dataclasses or Pydantic models, and async/await for concurrency. We use clear import paths and avoid circular dependencies to maintain readability and maintainability.

The code must be production-ready while remaining easy to understand and modify. We prioritize code clarity and maintainability, ensuring that each module can be tested and reused independently. We avoid unnecessary complexity and always favor straightforward, well-documented solutions.
